This lab took me about 4 hours.

The overall function instructions are not very clear. I could 
not find the names required for the functions +,-,*,/. Also,
it seemed like there was a lot of conflicting requirements.
Adding user validation for just the function request seems
strange. I am worried that my program will behave differently
on my computer than on the grader's computer.
