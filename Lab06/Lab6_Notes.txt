Lab 6 Notes:

Main project files: bounce_part1.c, bounce_part2.c, bounce_part3.c – contains main()
EC: bounce_ec.c

Broken into multiple parts (ex: labs 1-3).

Oled.h and .c are given as is - don't mess with them.

Overall notes:
--------------
-> LATE  register Each bit in this register controls the output of a pin: 1 means high and 0 
means low. 
(The LEDs are on pins E0 through E7 and a high output corresponds to the LED being enabled or on.)

-> TRISE register Turns pin into an input and clearing that bit (to 0) sets it to an output


PART 1:
-------
>Create the led.h file.

-> Header guards are required for file.
-> IN file add xc.h file.
-> using a struct (TimerResult)

-> No leds files given.
